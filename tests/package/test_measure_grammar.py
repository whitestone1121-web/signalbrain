"""Measure-grammar contracts: shell operators are refused with diagnosis.

The 0582 failure mode in the reference deployment: `cmd 2>&1 | grep x` was
tokenized, passing "|" as an argument — the pipeline never ran and the measure
failed opaquely. Bare shell grammar is now refused; put complex measurement
logic in a committed script and invoke that script as argv.
